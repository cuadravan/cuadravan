## About Me

I’m a **Computer Engineering student** focusing on building **end-to-end applications** with **.NET** and **Microsoft Azure**. I work across software, hardware, and cloud systems to create practical, reliable solutions.

### **What I work on / am working on:**

#### **A. Software Development**

* **.NET Full-Stack Development** – Cross-platform applications using .NET MAUI and ASP.NET Core Web APIs (MongoDB Atlas). *(Currently working on this)*
* **Web Development** – Simple HTML/CSS/JS projects (e.g., decimal to binary converter, weather app) for practicing frontend fundamentals. *(Currently working on this)*
* **GUI Development** – PySide6, Java Swing, WinForms.

#### **B. Data, Machine Learning, and Geospatial Systems**

* **GIS & Machine Learning** – Government-approved vegetation health, urban development trend, and land cover analysis using Python and Google Earth Engine.

#### **C. Embedded Systems and Low-Level Programming**

* **Embedded Systems & Robotics** – Autonomous sprayer robot software on Raspberry Pi, and a line follower robot with color detection on PIC16F877A.
* **Operating Systems Concepts** – C implementations of CPU scheduling algorithms, dining philosophers, and producer–consumer synchronization.
* **8086 Assembly** – Low-level register and memory manipulation using Intel 8086 assembly.

#### **D. Cloud and Deployment**

* **Cloud Deployment** – Azure App Service and cloud-integrated backend systems. *(Currently working on this)*

#### **E. Algorithms and Problem-Solving**

* **Algorithm & DSA Practice** – Ongoing problem-solving on LeetCode to strengthen data structures, algorithms, and computational thinking. *(Currently working on this)*

In short, I enjoy working with computers from hardware to software and to everything that's in between.
