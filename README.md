## About Me
I‚Äôm a Computer Engineering student with a strong foundation in both software and hardware, bringing a systems-level perspective to software development.

I build reliable applications using .NET MAUI and ASP.NET Core, with experience deploying secure, cloud-based solutions on Microsoft Azure. My work includes designing Web APIs with Azure SQL Database backends and publishing them to Azure App Service, enabling mobile and cross-platform integration. I also have experience developing in other GUI frameworks like PySide6, Java Swing, and WinForms.

I‚Äôm expanding into front-end web development while strengthening my skills in modern programming practices, cloud services, and database systems.
