# Van Kristian Cuadra

I am currently focused on building as much **domain knowledge and expertise** on firmware engineering within the printing solutions industry.

I have a strong passion for exploring and comprehending the full spectrum of computer abstraction, with a background ranging from **8086 assembly, OS kernel simulation, and autonomous robotics firmware** to **full-stack .NET applications, cloud services, and CI/CD workflows**. These are found in my featured works and pinned repositories below.

* **Currently:** Starting out my career by specializing in Firmware Engineering at an R&D company
* **Background:** BSCpE (Top Graduate and Magna Cum Laude, USJ-R)
* **Beyond the code:** Books, rhythm games, and music
