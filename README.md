## About Me

I’m a **Computer Engineer** focusing on building **end-to-end applications** with **.NET** and **Microsoft Azure**. I work across software, hardware, and cloud systems to create practical, reliable solutions.

### **What I work on:**

#### **A. Software Development**

* **Cross Platform App Development** – Windows and Android application using one ```.NET MAUI``` codebase.
* **API Backend Server Development** – RESTful API using ```ASP.NET Core Web API```.
* **Web Development** – Simple ```HTML/CSS/JS``` and ```Angular``` exercises for practicing frontend fundamentals.
* **Other/Desktop App Development** – Other frameworks I've worked with: ```PySide6```, ```Java Swing```, ```WinForms```.

#### **B. Cloud & DevOps**
* **CI/CD & Cloud Deployment** – Automate the deployment of my backend API using ```GitHub Actions``` targeting ```Azure App Service```.
* **GIS & Cloud Data Mining** – Queried and processed cloud-native geospatial datasets on ```Google Earth Engine``` using ```Python``` workflows to extract relevant data for urban management.

#### **C. AI & Machine Learning**

* **GIS & Machine Learning** – Worked with ```U-Net (deep learning model) using TensorFlow``` to perform semantic segmentation for land cover classification.

#### **D. Embedded Systems and Low-Level Programming**

* **Embedded Systems & Robotics** – Autonomous sprayer robot software on ```Raspberry Pi 4```, and a line follower robot with color detection on ```PIC16F877A```.
* **Operating Systems Concepts** – ```C``` implementations of CPU scheduling algorithms, dining philosophers, and producer–consumer synchronization.
* **8086 Assembly** – Low-level register and memory manipulation using ```Intel 8086 assembly```.

#### **E. Algorithms and Problem-Solving**

* **Algorithm & DSA Practice** – Ongoing problem-solving on ```LeetCode``` to strengthen data structures, algorithms, and computational thinking. 

In short, I enjoy working with computers from hardware to software and to everything that's in between.

## Projects

### Software
* **[Project Linkage](https://github.com/cuadravan/PLinkage)** – A full-stack cross-platform app system connecting project owners and skill providers, featuring project posting, user profiles, messaging, location-based matching, and contract tracking.  
* **Urban Green Space Management GIS Desktop App using AI** – A desktop GIS app built with PySide6, TensorFlow, and Google Earth Engine API to analyze urban green spaces from satellite imagery. ⚠️ Note: This repository is private as it contains work from our completed academic research and cannot be shared publicly.  
* **Mobile App with Backend Server** – A mobile application developed using .NET MAUI with a backend powered by ASP.NET Core Web API, Entity Framework Core, and Azure SQL Database. The API was deployed to Azure App Service to enable secure cloud integration. ⚠️ Note: This repository is private as it is covered under an NDA for my internship project.

### Hardware / Firmware
* **[Autonomous Pesticide Sprayer Robot](https://github.com/cuadravan/raspi-pesticide-sprayer-robot)** – An embedded systems project to automate pesticide spraying using Raspberry Pi 4.  
* **[Line Follower Robot with Color Detection](https://github.com/cuadravan/pic16f877a-line-follower-color-detection)** – An embedded systems project that combines line following with color detection to change its behavior using PIC16F877A.
